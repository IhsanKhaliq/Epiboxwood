# Main effect of weather variables


## M1 (min_rh, min_temp, max_ws, mean_rain_per_rainy_day)

Using mean rain per rainy day, and mean values for daily minimum relative
humidity, daily minimum temperatures, and daily maximum wind speed  over the trial duration.

```{r m1}
m1 <- gam(disease_severity ~  s(min_rh, k = 10) + s(min_temp, k = 10) + s(max_ws, k =7) + s(avg_daily_rain, k = 9) + s(total_days, k=9), family = betar(),  method = "REML", data = dat_seasonal)

```

fig_2 <- p1 + p2 + p3 + p4 + p5 + plot_layout(ncol = 3, nrow = 2)

```{r save-fig2, include=FALSE, eval=FALSE}

```


## M2 (min_rh, min_temp_rain, max_ws_rain, mean_rain_per_rainy_day)

Based on correlation analysis, daily minimum temperature and daily maximum wind speed during rainy days has a higher correlation with disease, so use these variables instead of mean values for daily minimum temperatures and daily maximum wind speed over the trial duration.

```{r m2}
m2 <- gam(disease_severity ~  s(min_rh, k = 9) + s(min_temp_rain, k = 9) + s(max_ws_rain, k =7) + s(avg_daily_rain, k = 9) + s(total_days, k=9), family = betar(),  method = "REML", data = dat_seasonal)

summary(m2)

draw(m2, resid_col = TRUE, rug = FALSE, caption = NULL)
```


Same output as `m1`.



## M3 (max_rh_dry, min_temp_rain, max_ws_rain, mean_rain_per_rainy_day)

Add daily maximum relative humidity during dry days, which has the highest
correlation with the disease.

```{r m3}
m3 <- gam(disease_severity ~  s(max_rh_dry, k = 10) + s(min_temp_rain, k = 9) + s(max_ws_rain, k =7) + s(avg_daily_rain, k = 9) + s(total_days, k=10), family = betar(),  method = "REML", data = dat_seasonal)

summary(m3)

draw(m3, resid_col = TRUE, rug = FALSE, caption = NULL)
```


Only rainfall has a significant on disease severity. 



## M4 (RH2, min_temp_rain, max_ws_rain, mean_rain_per_rainy_day)

Use the number of days with relative humidity over 65% as a predictor, which has the second highest correlation with the disease after after maximum relative humidity during dry conditions.

```{r m4}
m4 <- gam(disease_severity ~  s(RH2, k = 9) + s(min_temp_rain, k = 9) + s(max_ws_rain, k =7) + s(avg_daily_rain, k = 9) + s(total_days, k=9), family = betar(),  method = "REML", data = dat_seasonal)

summary(m4)

draw(m4, resid_col = TRUE, rug = FALSE, caption = NULL)
```


Same output as `m1` and `m2`, but trial duration has a significant effect. This means trial duration is important when number of days with relative humidity over 65% is used as a predictor, so this predictor is not normalising the data for varying trial period.



## M5 (Mean RH, min_temp_rain, max_ws_rain, mean_rain_per_rainy_day)

Use mean RH as a predictor, which has the third highest correlation with the disease after after maximum relative humidity during dry conditions. 

```{r m5}
m5 <- gam(disease_severity ~  s(mean_rh, k = 9) + s(min_temp, k = 9) + s(max_ws, k =7) + s(avg_daily_rain, k = 10) + s(total_days, k=9), family = betar(),  method = "REML", data = dat_seasonal)

summary(m5)

draw(m5, resid_col = TRUE, rug = FALSE, caption = NULL)
```


Only rain has no significant effect. Trial duration has a significant effect. This means trial duration is important when number of days with relative humidity over 65% is used as a predictor, so this predictor is not normalising the data for varying trial period.



## Compare models and choose the best fit model 

### AIC, BIC 

```{r}
models <- list(
  mod1 = m1,
  mod2 = m2,
  mod3 = m3,
  mod4 = m4,
  mod5 = m5
)
map_df(models, glance, .id = "model") %>%
  arrange(AIC)
```

The `m1` model has lowest AIC and BIC values

### R-squared values

```{r}
enframe(
  c(
    mod1 = summary(m1)$r.sq,
    mod2 = summary(m2)$r.sq,
    mod3 = summary(m3)$r.sq,
    mod4 = summary(m4)$r.sq,
    mod5 = summary(m5)$r.sq
  )
) %>%
  arrange(desc(value))
```

The `m1` model has the highest R-squared values. 

## Best fit model `m` diagnostics

### Check if the best fit model `m1` predictions are reliable 

```{r check-m1}
simulateResiduals(m1, plot = T, quantreg = T)
```

Yes, predictions are reliable and truly represent the data.



### Diagnostics plots

```{r diagnostics-plot-m1}
m1_vis <- getViz(m1)
check(
  m1_vis,
  a.qq = list(method = "tnorm",
              a.cipoly = list(fill = "light blue")),
  a.respoi = list(size = 0.5),
  a.hist = list(bins = 10)
)
```


The `k` values are greater than `edf` and p-values are not significant. More data will further improve the fit.



### Check autocorrelation

```{r check-autocorrelation}
performance::check_autocorrelation(m1)
```

No problems detected.

The `k` values are greater than `edf` and p-values are not significant. 


### Check autocorrelation

### Plot interaction effect of mean rain per rainy day and daily mean maximum
wind speed using `visreg` package

```{r fig_S2}

                     labels = sprintf("%0.1f", seq(2.8, 3.7, length.out = 5)))


fig_S2 
```



```{r save-figS2, include=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
ggsave(

  width = 9,
  height = 9,
  units = "in",
  dpi = 600,

```



### Plot interaction effect of mean mininum RH and mean mininum temp

```{r}
fig_S3 <-
  visreg::visreg(
    mod1,

    by = "daily_minimum_temperature",
    gg = TRUE,
    rug = FALSE,

                     labels = sprintf("%0.1f", seq(29.7, 67.9, length.out = 6)))

fig_S3   
```


The plot for interaction effect between RH and temperature suggests a negative interaction effect. 

```{r save-figS3, include=FALSE, eval=FALSE}

  plot = fig_S3,
  width = 9,
  height = 9,
  units = "in",
  dpi = 600,

The plot for the interaction effect between max_ws and avg_daily_rain suggests a negative interaction effect.
